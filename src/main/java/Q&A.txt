Each map and reduce task run on a container
container is like mini jvm allocated to run one map or reduce task

main schedular - resource manager
helper - node manager for each node

no. of map task(1 mapper) depends on number of input files.
if input files size is greater than minimum block size it gets splitted.


com.Application Master - The ApplicationMaster is, in effect, an instance of a framework-specific
library and is responsible for negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and working
with the NodeManager(s) to execute and monitor the containers and their resource consumption.
